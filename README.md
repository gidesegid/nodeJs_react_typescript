# Example App Using Node, TypeScript, and React
This example app shows how to create a simple users list and their details  using Node and TypeScript, as well as a frontend to interact with it using React typescript.

Prerequisites: Node.js.

## Getting Started
To install this example application, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gidesegid/nodeJs_react_typescript.git

Go to specific folder and run
npm install
```
This will install a local copy of the project. 

```bash
First is first:There are two backend folders.
The first backend folder (backend) is node js server written in es6 based and node js express (no typescript).
The second backend folder(backendWithTypescript) is node js server written in es6 based and node js express and typescript.
```
After running npm install on any folder then all necessary dependencies will be installed and you are good to go.

To see a sample in a browser you need to run any one or maybe both of the servers.

There are three main folders: the first folder is for the backend(nodejs server) and second folder is for the backend with typescript(node js server) and the third folder is  frontend react typescript(client).

At each folders you have to install the npm package by "npm install".

### Run node js server(backend)

### Run react typescript(frontend)
